Metadata Reproducer — LLM-free auto-annotator.

Converts images + path data (gate3_perframe + gate3_landmarks + reference_path)
into R2R-style navigation instructions WITHOUT any LLM calls.

Vocabulary distributions calibrated from GT analysis:
  - Non-final pass verbs: walk past(40%) / walk toward(20%) / go past(15%) / pass the(15%) / walk(10%)
  - Opening verbs: walk(34%) / go(19%) / exit(11% closed rooms) / turn(17%) / leave(4%)
  - Stop verbs: stop(55%) / wait(35%) / halt(10%)
  - Stop preps: near(25%) / in front of(20%) / at the(20%) / by the(18%) / next to(17%)

Research findings (from v203 analysis):
  - walk_past 20-25% in non-final positions → optimal SR
  - walk_to ≤6% in non-final positions → optimal SR
  - 3-sentence rate ~38% optimal
  - Vocabulary diversity (go_past, pass_the, walk_toward) boosts model grounding

v219 (opening-sentence implicit turns):
  - v218 reduced unhandled-turn explicit language (1.97 vs GT=0.66)
  - v219 extends to opening sentence: when non-sharp turn leads to known t0_room,
    prefer "Exit the bedroom and walk into the hallway" over "Exit the bedroom and turn left."
  - Applied in 3 patterns: (A) n_turns==1 closed-room exit, (B) r<0.28 merge,
    (C) r<0.82 closed/open room exit. Probability 55-60% when conditions met.
  - Expected avg_explicit_turns: ~1.3-1.5 (GT=0.66, v218=1.97)
